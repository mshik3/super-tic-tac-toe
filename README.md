A modern, real-time multiplayer implementation of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe built with React, TypeScript, and Cloudflare Workers.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Play against opponents worldwide with WebSocket connections
- **Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe**: Strategic gameplay with nested boards
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive interface built with React and Tailwind CSS
- **Serverless Backend**: Powered by Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects
- **Simple Deployment**: Git-connected Cloudflare Pages with automatic builds

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Zustand
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers, Durable Objects, WebSockets
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages (Frontend), Cloudflare Workers (Backend)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm or yarn
- Cloudflare account (for deployment)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd super-tic-tac-toe
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   # Frontend dependencies
   npm install

   # Worker dependencies
   cd worker
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Start development servers**

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start frontend dev server
   npm run dev

   # Terminal 2: Start worker dev server
   cd worker
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Worker API: http://localhost:8787

## 🚀 Deployment Setup

This project uses **git-connected Cloudflare Pages** for the frontend and **Wrangler CLI** for the worker backend.

### One-Time Setup: Connect GitHub to Cloudflare Pages

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (if you haven't already)

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Cloudflare Pages**

   - Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) → **Pages**
   - Click **"Connect to Git"**
   - Select your GitHub repository
   - Configure build settings:
     - **Build command**: `npm run build`
     - **Build output directory**: `dist`
     - **Root directory**: `/` (leave empty)
   - Click **"Save and Deploy"**

3. **Set up Worker deployment** (one-time)
   ```bash
   cd worker
   npx wrangler login  # Login to your Cloudflare account
   npm run deploy      # Deploy your worker
   ```

### Daily Workflow (Super Simple!)

**Frontend changes:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "update frontend"
git push
# ✨ Frontend auto-deploys to Cloudflare Pages!
```

**Worker changes:**

```bash
# Make your worker changes, then:
npm run deploy:worker
# Or deploy everything:
npm run deploy:all
```

**That's it!** No secrets, no complex CI/CD, no configuration files to maintain.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start a Game**: Choose between local multiplayer or find an online opponent
2. **Game Rules**: This is Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe - win small boards to claim them in the big board
3. **Strategic Play**: Your move determines which small board your opponent must play in next
4. **Win Condition**: Get three small boards in a row on the big board to win!

## 🔄 Deployment Pipeline

Simple and automatic deployment:

1. **Frontend**: Push to git → Cloudflare Pages auto-builds and deploys
2. **Worker**: Run `npm run deploy:worker` when you change backend code
3. **Quality**: Run `npm run lint` before committing (optional but recommended)

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start frontend development server
- `npm run build` - Build frontend for production
- `npm run lint` - Check code quality
- `npm run deploy:worker` - Deploy worker to Cloudflare
- `npm run deploy:all` - Build frontend + deploy worker
